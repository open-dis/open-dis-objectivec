// An entity's associations with other entities and/or locations. For each association, this record shall specify the type of the association, the associated entity's EntityID and/or the associated location's world coordinates. This record may be used (optionally) in a transfer transaction to send internal state data from the divesting simulation to the acquiring simulation (see 5.9.4). This record may also be used for other purposes. Section 6.2.10
